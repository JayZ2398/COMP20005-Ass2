===COMP20005  Ass2===
===MASS COMPARISON===

-This collection of stuff contains 100 extra test files, which were randomly generated by Tsz Kiu Pang's randtree program.
-For extra project confidence, you can use the scripts provided to generate your program's output to these 100 files, 
and compare them to the outputs Tsz Kiu Pang and I both got from our programs (in Sample Outputs).
-The comparison is done with Anh Vo's mydiff program, which has been written specifically to compare outputs for this assignment :)

Massive credit due to Tsz Kiu Pang and Anh Vo :)

Instructions:
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Place the 'Mass Comparison' folder in the same directory as your ass2.c.
	- Make sure that you copy the entire folder, not the files inside it.
2. Open your MinGW shell, and cd into the Mass Comparison folder.

0. Make sure that your assignment is named ass2.c.
1. Place the 'Mass Comparison' folder in the same directory as your ass2.c.
	- Make sure that you copy the entire folder, not the files inside it.
	- You don't need to compile your program - this script will do it for you.
2. Open your MinGW shell, and cd into the Mass Comparison folder.
	a) If you're on a Mac/dimefox/UNIX, add a _unix suffix to all the files from now on. I.e. compare_outputs_unix.txt.

3. Type
	./generate_outputs.txt
and hit enter. This will generate a bunch of outputs from your program called 'your-testX-out.txt'.
4. Once that's finished, type
	./compare_outputs.txt
and hit enter. This will run Anh Vo's mydiff program and print out:
	- Any different lines between your program's output and the sample ones.
	- Some tips about what was different (i.e. too few/many blank lines).
5. If the commands in steps 3 and 4 don't work, first type:
		chmod +x ./generate_outputs.txt
	and
		chmox +x ./compare_outputs.txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
	then try the steps again.

	then try the steps again.
	
Comparison Notes:
- If you get a couple differences (say, 2 or 3 of the 100 files), this is normal!
	- As doubles are handled differently between machines, there are some tiles that might be assigned to different trees.
